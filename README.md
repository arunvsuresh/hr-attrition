# Employee Attrition Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is a part of my Master's program in Data Science and focuses on predicting employee attrition using a logistic regression model. The goal was to identify the most influential factors contributing to attrition based on HR employee data.

## Project Description
In this project, I leveraged a logistic regression model to analyze various features such as distance from work, job satisfaction, work/life balance, and more from HR employee data. The objective was to determine which of these factors played a significant role in employee attrition.

## Key Features
- Utilized logistic regression for predictive modeling.
- Employed HR employee data containing relevant features.
- Explored factors like distance from work, job satisfaction, and work/life balance.
- Assessed the influence of these factors on employee attrition.

## Usage
This repository contains the code and datasets used for the analysis. You can explore the Jupyter Notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the project.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels

## Future Work
Future work on this project may involve fine-tuning the model, exploring additional data sources, or implementing advanced machine learning techniques to further improve attrition prediction accuracy.
